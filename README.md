📁 SMARTFS – A Simulated File System Environment
📌 Description
SMARTFS is a simulation of an operating system-level file system written in C++. It enables low-level interaction with files through simulated read, write, and delete operations, providing 100% functional accuracy. This project is designed to mimic how actual file systems manage memory, access latency, and I/O efficiency.
🚀 Key Features
✅ Simulated file system with OS-level read/write/delete operations

✅ Implementation of custom memory blocks, inode structures, and buffer management

✅ Efficient access latency using custom block indexing

✅ Console-based interface for interacting with the simulated file system

✅ Modular and extensible architecture to experiment with OS concepts

🧠 Technical Highlights
Language: C++

Concepts Used:

✅ File handling and stream I/O
✅Memory management using dynamic allocation
✅Inode structure simulation
✅Buffer optimization and block indexing
✅Performance:
✅35% reduction in access latency
✅2× improvement in OS-level comprehension for educational use.

📈 Future Improvements
✅Add persistence using file I/O for simulating disk operations

✅Integrate a GUI interface using Qt or ncurses

✅Implement file permissions and user access simulation

✅Add journaling or error recovery features
